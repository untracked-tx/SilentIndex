# SilentIndex: Doctrine Weapons

> “Some economies aren’t built. They’re inherited.  
> Some currencies aren’t tracked. They’re felt.”

**SilentIndex** is not a utility repo.  
It is a weaponized doctrine artifact—  
designed to mirror the unrecorded exchanges shaping your day.

These scripts don’t fix anything.  
They just log what no one else will.

## Weapons

- `/cli/emotional_ledger.py` — Tracks unspoken emotional labor like currency  
- `/sim/value_drift.py` — Simulates a living economy of invisible emotional forces  
- `/ghost/invoice_generator.py` — Issues quiet emotional invoices you didn’t know you were carrying

Fork clean. Vanish clean.
